# `v7` Input Method

This project aims to analyze the Vietnamese language to develop a faster typing method by implementing word prediction based on partial input. For instance, inputting only `x0ch2` should yield `xin ch√†o` as the predicted output.

*Completeness:* `v7` is basically better VNI, everything VNI can do, `v7` also can do. So you can input any possible Vietnamese words with `v7`.

Use the below script to try `v7` method!

## Motivation

- The Vietnamese language consists of many diacritics, making typing in Vietnamese time-consuming due to the need for these diacritical marks.
- `v7` aims to simplify Vietnamese typing by using only the initial consonant and tone to predict the intended words. For example, instead of typing `t∆∞·ªüng t∆∞·ª£ng` as `tuong73 tuong75` (`VNI`) or `tuongwr tuongwj` (`Telex`), you can type `t3t5` with `v7`!
- Naturally, this reduction in key usage leads to some information loss. For instance, the input `t3t5` could also correspond to `ti·ªÉu ti·ªán`, as `3` represents the hook tone `h·ªèi` and `5` represents the underdot tone `n·∫∑ng`.
- This project analyzes and addresses these problems to ultimately introduce `v7`, enhancing the Vietnamese typing experience.

## Overview

### Input Style

`v7` inherits both from former VNI and Telex.

- **Special consonants**:
  - `g` for both `g` and `gh`.
  - `ng` for both `ng` and `ngh`.
  - `z` for `gi`. (`z6` ‚Üí `gi√∫p`, `gi·∫øt`, `gi√°p`, ...)
  - `dd` for `ƒë`. (`dd4` ‚Üí `ƒë√£`, `ƒë√£i`, `ƒë·ªó`, ...) (`Telex style`)

- **Tones** (`VNI style`):
  - `0` for no tones: `tu√¢n`, `c√¢m`, `t√¢n`...
  - `1` for normal acute: `c·∫•m`, `ti·∫øng`, `t·∫•n`, `th√≠nh`... (compare with `6` to see the differences)
  - `2` for grave: `tu·∫ßn`, `c·∫ßm`, `t·∫ßn`...
  - `3` for hook: `t·∫©n`, `c·∫©m`, `h·ªâ`...
  - `4` for tilde: `m√£i`, `r√£`, `ph≈©`...
  - `5` for normal underdot: `nh·∫≠m`, `ph·ª•ng`, `ƒë·ªôn`, `m·∫°nh`... (compare with `7` to see the differences)
  - `6` for `entering/checked` acute: `c·∫•p`, `ti·∫øc`, `t·∫•t`, `th√≠ch`... (everything with acute and ends with `p`, `t`, `c`, `ch` must be tone `6`)
  - `7` for `entering/checked` underdot: `nh·∫≠p`, `ph·ª•c`, `ƒë·ªôt`, `m·∫°ch`... (everything with underdot and ends with `p`, `t`, `c`, `ch` must be tone `7`)
  
- **Special vowels**:
  - Lots of `ƒÉ`, `√¢`, `√™`, `√¥`, `∆°`, `∆∞` when typing Vietnamese? Not a problem anymore because just typing `a`, `e`, `o`, `u` and `v7` will predict the most suitable ones for you! This feature also helps reducing number of keys you have to type!

This 8-tone system follows the [Vietnamese Eight-Tone Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_phonology#Eight-tone_analysis).

**Note:** *If you aren't familiar with 8-tone system, you can still config to use traditional VNI 6-tone. But using 8-tone system is highly recommended for much much better AI result!* 

### Platform Support

**Operating Systems**:
- ‚úÖ **macOS** - Please switch to English keyboard
- ‚úÖ **Windows** - Please switch to English keyboard
- ‚õî **Linux** ‚Äì Not supported *yet*

**Current Limitations**:
- üö´ **CapsLock**: Not currently supported. Please make sure CapsLock is off when typing.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Accessibility**: Some platforms (e.g., macOS) may require enabling accessibility permissions such as input monitoring for the tool to function correctly.
- Stable version in progress...

### Modes

`v7` predicts the words/phrases users want to type by checking and ranking possible words/phrases. 

#### AI Mode
This mode utilize `v7gpt`: a GPT-like model with a custom tokenizer only for `v7`, trained on a Vietnamese corpus, based on Andrej Karpathy's [nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/build-nanogpt).

- **Advantages**:
  - Works in any circumstances.
  - Understands the context in which the user is writing to predict the most suitable next word.
  - Can effectively predict entire sentences at a time.
  
## Run the App
<!-- TODO: (Warn user about the computer accessibility issues) -->
This project uses Python 3.12. 

#### Using AI Mode
To run the app in AI Mode, follow these steps:

1. Install the required packages for AI Mode (Torch is required):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements_ai.txt
    ```
2. Download the pretrained model checkpoint:
    ```bash
    gdown 1dDP0jIJ79syE6vt6QnVl05_4fYpuwrqd -O checkpoints/v7gpt-1.3.pth
    # Or download the file at https://drive.google.com/file/d/12ZBG5IBOKmgmv7mh32uFdDUqr-K0SzPS/view?usp=drive_link to checkpoints/v7gpt-1.3.pth
    ```
3. Start the application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
